## The Fastest Way to Improve

> The fastest way to improve is to learn from others.
>
> Read good books
>
> Talk to people who have done it
>
> Soak up the lessons of the past
>
> Learn from the experiments history has already run and you can start the race halfway finished.

## Repeat what works.

> “Every statistician knows that a large, relevant sample size is their best friend.
> What are the three largest, most relevant sample sizes for identifying universal principles?
>
> Bucket number one is inorganic systems, which are 13.7 billion years in size. It’s all the laws of math and physics, the entire physical universe. Bucket number two is organic systems, 3.5 billion years of biology on Earth. And bucket number three is human history, you can pick your own number, I picked 20,000 years of recorded human behavior
>
> Those are the three largest sample sizes we can access and the most relevant.”
>
> — Peter Kaufman

## Great Stories

> Great stories build relationships and make people care
>
> Character-driven stories make us care
>
> The ultimate love potion is stories
>
> Have a great character that people can connect with
>
> Great stories have tension
>
> Tension leads to attention
>
> Start with a story
>
> Great stories must be appropriate for the stage of the relationship
>
> Working on the right thing is more important than working hard.
>
> Why use a long word, if you can use a short word
>
> Do something worth writing
>
> Either write something worth reading or do something worth writing
>
> Give them what they need to know, not everything you know(If they want more information, they will ask for it)
>
> Keep it simple, keep it short
>
> Starts with what is important to them
